# tictactoe
This is one of the very first full programs that I made.
I have tried to make it as simple as possible, defining functions and adding comments so that even a beginner can easily understand the code.

# working
This is a python based code which first takes input if player 1 want to opt for X or O and then randomly assigns either player 1 or player 2 to go first, the players can mark their X or O which is shown in the tictactoe grid after every turn, after the game is over, you get a chance to play again or exit.

Thanks!
